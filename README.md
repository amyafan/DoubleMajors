# Double Majors Graphics

This is the HTML behind an interactive graphic for ["Is Duke interdisciplinary? A look into data on double majors"](https://www.dukechronicle.com/article/2019/02/is-duke-interdisciplinary-a-look-into-data-on-double-majors), a piece I reported and wrote in college that looked at double majors for students. 

The graphic couldn't be embedded into the article unfortunately, but a link to the graphic can be found [here](https://amyafan.github.io/DoubleMajors/).

To see the code that produced the graphic, please see ________. 

There's a second graphic that just looks at majors by field. The repository for that can be found [here](https://amyafan.github.io/DoubleMajors2/)
