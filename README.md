# Double Majors Graphics

This is the html behind a graphic that I created for [this Duke Chronicle article](https://www.dukechronicle.com/article/2019/02/is-duke-interdisciplinary-a-look-into-data-on-double-majors) looking at double majors for students 

The graphic couldn't be embedded directly unfortunately but can be found [here](https://amyafan.github.io/DoubleMajors/).

There's a second graphic that just looks at majors by field. The repository for that can be found [here](https://amyafan.github.io/DoubleMajors2/)
